# Music Releases

This pair programming assignment was to build a latest music releases website with React and JSX, using multiple components.

## The problem

We started by creating the structure for our first component, and then based on this structure we decided what data we would need to give that component when we mounted it. We then continued in this same pattern for the next component. We used stack overflow a lot during the process.

If we had more time we would look into how to do the live fetch in React so that the music releases would be up to date.
